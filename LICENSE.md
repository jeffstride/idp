The license for this repo is much like the license for [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/blob/master/LICENSE).

Most of the content of this repo is original text and code to created to
augment the cse163.github.io book. There is also modified homework assignments
that allow students to not be confused with the specific tooling at the
University of Washington. We will use multiple licenses,
one for the "text" of the book, one for for the surrounding code, and
another for the modified works from cse163.
