```{admonition} NCHS Students
:class: note
Mr. Rukman has an new IDP site for you. [Please go there](https://nchs-cs.github.io/idp/).
```

```{admonition} Website Mission
:class: note
Allow a student learning Data Science to “window shop” for technology and methods.     
```

In the Fall of 2024, Mr. Stride has moved to UW Bothell and this site is no longer a primary source of information for students at NCHS. As a result, content is transforming to reference material on Python in general instead of directions on high school homework.

This website is intended to augment the [CSE 163: Intermediate Data Programming](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse163) curriculum and [online book](https://cse163.github.io/book) provided by Hunter Schafer.   

Mr. Stride has created "this ridiculous" thing...
```{admonition} Video Reference

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tHU1uoR8L30?start=0&end=79" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

```

Things this website hopes to have information on:
* Machine Learning 
* Plotting 
* Cheatsheet Notes  

Once you are ready to read, you can navigate the book using the sidebar on the left!  
  
Here are a bunch of TODOs for Mr. Stride:  
* Explain how an object can implement \_\_iter\_\_() and return a list of instance fields so that a caller can 'unpack' the object into a set of fields. Note that list object is iterable and can also be unpacked. It doesn't have to be a tuple.  
* Add cross-referencing across the topics so that when an example method uses something advanced, then that can be further discussed in another page/topic.  
* Generators (and recursion in a generator... ouch!)  
* walrus operator  
* decorators: @staticmethod, @classmethod  
* interfaces (how are they different from classes)  
* decorators as found here: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/decorator  
* closures and nested methods  
* Dictionary comprehensions  
* map, filter, reduce,  
* a summary of good built-in python functions: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html   
* Math to reverse randomized response   
* 5 stages of research (gather, organize, report, conclude, act or enact policy)
* confirmation bias  (other biases?)   
* "stuff" in my Notes directory   
* prosecutors fallacy, simpson's paradox, (other things from good videos)
