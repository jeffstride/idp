# Predicting Success

In the Fall of 2025, I took only 14 questions that could be seen as predicting success. I had the students answer the questions in the first week of class--before they had done any homework or spent time in class. To account for the fact that they could not answer how difficult CSS 143 was, or how much they enjoyed the homework given in 143, I had to I altered a few question. Effectively, I used they experience with 142 as a proxy.  

## First Exam Results
The plots below show the results quite well. With fewer data points, I decided to use 6 as my point of division to create the two sub-groups. The disadvantaged group would have fewer than 6, and the advantaged group would have more than 6. I did not include those who had exactly 6. 

Out of the 45 students originally enrolled, 3 students did not take the survey and 6 students dropped the course before taking the first exam. This left only 36 students to analyze. 

Nine students were in the disadvantaged group. Sixteen were in the advantaged group. These numbers are admittedly small.

### Free Response
The performance on the Free Response portion of the exam showed a greater divide.

### Total Exam 
When we include the Multiplce Choice portion of the exam, the significance is diminished.
