# <i class="fas fa-book fa-fw"></i> Data Organization

## Overview
You will deliver the following:  
* Reduced data through any `pre-processing`.
* Code that will:
    * Collect Data (if there is any `web scraping` or use of `API`)  
    * Reduce, Filter and Organize the data
    * Test (if you are doing the Unit Test Challenge)
* Sketches of target plots  
* Some Unit Tests (Challenge Goal only)  

More often than not, the raw data is not ready for plotting. The data needs to be rearranged and organized into a format that allows for `matplotlib.pyplot` to plot. The data may need to be reduced, filtered, joined, calculated or reorganized. 

Things NOT necessary for this deliverable:
- Final Code that does plotting or machine learning
- Plots
- Final Report
- Final Presentation

## Sketches of Plots
Think about the types of plots you want to create and how those could answer the questions you've posed. Be creative and hypothetical in this step. Imagine what a plot would look like and then sketch it out by hand or using Paint.  

The goal is to imagine what your plots might look like while not constraining yourself by your coding abilities. Consider ways to convey information while assuming data values. If you find that you're drawing simple, repetitive bar plots or line plots, then you need to dig deeper into your creativity. Get some inspiration by looking at other published reports or at the Visualizations on <a href="../../visualizations/case_study_dist.html">IDP MrStride</a>. 

Things to consider:  
* How you might annotate your plots with values  
* Whether a curve of best fit is appropriate  
* How statistical significance might be added  
* How to sort values to make it more visually appealing  
* Use a TimeSeries - Average by some timeframe  
* How to layer more information into a single plot  
* How to use different types of plots along with impressive versions of each:
    * Bar Charts  
    * Pie Charts  
    * Box Plots  
    * Histograms  
    * Swarm Plots  
    * Area Plots  
    * Scatter Plots  
    * Geospatial  

```{admonition} Sample Sketch
:class: note dropdown
This sketch was created in Paint in about 15 minutes. These are sketches for a hypothetical project on the box office revenues of movies. The project is attempting to show correlation between box office revenues, Netflix earnings, and America's GDP.  

Do not be fooled! This sketch represents `C-` quality work. The sketches illustrate a few things that should be addressed early. Before submitting this Organization Deliverable, the sketches should be updated to address these shortcomings:  
* There are only 3 plots. Ouch!  
* The y-axes are not all labeled.  
* The bar chart showing genre of movies does not add any value to the research question. It is good that the bars are sorted by value, but there is no point to the chart.  
* I lack annotation. The bar chart could have values added to the top of the bars (or inside the bars). The line plots could highlight inflection points.  
* I need more creativity. Having only barchart and line plots is not enough. While line plots are fantastic at identifying correlations, there are other plots and activities that are great at doing showing correlation. The following example correlation methods may not be appropriate given the data collected or my research question. Regardless, here are some other methods:  
    * [Correlation Heatmap](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39409866/correlation-heatmap)  
    * <a href="../../Topics/machine_learning/feature-importance.html">Machine Learning and Feature Importance</a>   
    * Plotting Netflix vs GDP and then adding Statistical information such as `Coefficient of Determination`.  
* The graphs do not sufficiently deter critical counter arguments. For example, even though there is a negative correlation between Box Office revenue and Netflix earnings, we could show that other popular streaming services do (or do not) correlate.  

There are some positive realizations from doing these sketches that will impact my project's efforts:  
* I need data by year  
* I need to be able to do `twinx` plots--to plot lines with different scales on the same axis

## Replit Project
Your code is expected to be delivered on Replit.  

The code must run on replit or have an explanation in the `readme.md` file explaining the steps to run the code locally.  

You must follow the structure found in the template project. The Replit project has several important folders and files describe below.  

### Folders
You must make use of the **Folders** provided:  
* `data_organized` : This will contain data that is small enough for consumption and ready to be plotted. If the raw data from the data sources is dirty or too big for quick and repeated consumption, you need to reduce, normalize and organize the data first. Store the raw data in the raw_data folder. After you've cleaned and organized it, save the processed data into this folder. However, if the raw data is clean and small enough, and it does not need any preprocesssing, you can store the raw data here.  
* `plots` : All of your generated plots need to be saved here. It should contain only images.  
* `raw_data` : Dirty data goes here. Replit isn't so happy to have very large datasets uploaded, so if your data is very large, do not upload it. Instead, provide a link to a shared Google Drive that contains all of your raw data.  
* `test_data` : If you do a lot of data organization, you will want to test your code with test data. Store that test data here. Furthermore, in some uncommon cases you will have plots that will need to be "tested" by plotting fake (or test) data.

### Files
You must make use of the **Files** provided:
* `mach_learning.py` : If you are doing the Machine Learning challenge, create and train your models in this file. Be ready to do more than just create a model.   
* `main.py` : Create amazing plots in this file. You will read the data from `data_organized` (unless your raw data required no reduction, in which case you can read your data from `raw_data`). You will do plot-related work such as joins, column filtering, pivots, small calculations and other simple organizational work.  
* `prepocess_data.py` : This file is intended to do the following types of work:
    * download data from APIs  
    * screenscrape data from websites  
    * reduce the size of large datasets to something more manageable  
    * clean data: reduce/rename columns, normalize strings, adjust values  
    * generate data through relatively complicated calculations  
* `readme.md` : This file contains instructions to help Mr. Stride understand extended files & folders in your project. Also, if some/all of your project will not run on Replit, provide instructions for how to setup and run your code locally. Ideally, only some parts of your project would require custom setup while the rest will run on Replit.  
* `run_tests.py` : This is the entry point to running all of your tests. You can do simple testing as we have done all year in your homework assignments. Or, you can leverage Python's Unit Test Framework which is a bit more complicated, but super cool.  

## Preprocessing Data
To reduce processing time you should save your processed data into the folder 'data_organized'. You can do this with: `df.to_csv('data_organized/filename.csv')`

You will spend a surprising amount of time in this area. You will be much more successful if you can complete this early.  

You may have additional helper files besides `preprocess_data.py`, but, this file should be the entry point for that activity.

You should test this file's code in `run_tests.py`. 

It is possible that your raw data is small and uncomplicated. In which case, this file will do (virtually) nothing. You can

Each file has a header comment that explains what code belongs in each file. These files should have the main-method pattern to allow one to execute that functionality only.
