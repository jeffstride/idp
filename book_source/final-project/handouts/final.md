# <i class="fas fa-book fa-fw"></i> Final Code and Report

Your Final Report should be _about_ 10 pages long. You are allowed to have a longer report if there are many plots to show. However, the sum total amount of text found in the report should be limited to no more than 3 pages. In other words, if all the plots were removed, the report would be at most 3 pages long. 

Your code should be completely finalized and submitted. The code will be reviewed with three things in mind:  
1) to verify that it does indeed generate the plots found in the report.  
2) to estimate the quantity and quality of work.  
3) to validate that you met your Challenge Goals.  

The code will not be directly graded because it is simply the tool to generate the product of value--the report!  

## Overview
You will deliver the following:  
* A written report as a PDF file  
* Final code submission in Replit

Things NOT necessary for this deliverable:  
* Final Presentation  

Your report will focus on the plots that are to be appropriate, varied, creative, insightful, and annotated. The report will contain some English write-up, but the write-up is to be relatively short on words.

## Report Sections
Here are the sections you should have in your report:  
* **Title & Author(s)** : Have a title and list the authors.  
* **Abstract** : The abstract is a summary of the entire study, describing the context, research aim, methods, results and key conclusions. It should be 1-2 paragraphs long. It should include the focus/question, the approach, the findings and the conclusions. Abstracts should be self-contained and concise, explaining your work as briefly and clearly as possible.    
* **Results** : This the bulk of your report where you will display your plots. Label the figures so that when your text references them it is clear which plot is being referenced. This section must be 100% **data driven** and devoid of all speculation. Students are to briefly explain and describe what the data say. Do not explain _why_ the data is that way, only _that_ the data _is_ that way. Any subjective opinion or speculation must be put into the _Discussion_ section. All qualitative comments made about the data must be cited. More details below.  
* **Discussion** : This is an _optional_ section where you can make speculations about your data. The sky is the limit here. Go where your hear desires. Why do you think certain things are they way the data suggests? Or, why do you think the data is a poor representation of reality? Speculate away!   
* **Conclusion** : You should expand in more detail the conclusions of the sum total of your research. Aggregate and synthesize the results of the  individual plots into a final, grand conclusion. What are the potential implications of your results? Who might be benefit from your analysis and who might be excluded, or worse, harmed by it. Are there any biases in your data that might impact your results? Explicitly outline the limitations of your analysis and how others should or shouldnâ€™t use your conclusions.   
* **Further Research** : Undoubtedly you will discover more questions as you complete your research. Explain what new questions you could research if you had more data and/or more time.  
* **Challenge Goals** : List your challenge goals and expand on how it worked out. Did your effort pay back dividends?  If you scaled back or expanded, explain.  
* **References** : List all the sources cited in the paper.  

## Results Section
The goal of Data Science is to be [Data Driven](https://uta.pressbooks.pub/datanotebook/chapter/1-2-data-driven-research/). Refrain from subjective opinions which are typically based on personal beliefs, preferences, or anecdotal evidence. If you want to conclude that one thing might be due to another you must present data to illustrate the correlation. Alternatively, you can provide a citation to a book, article or research paper that supports your position. <a href="#footnotes"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <a href="#footnotes"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

Let the data speak for itself.  

Work hard to create plots that speak volumes!  

## Footnotes
[1] Articles are heavily influenced by the author's desire to sell their work. Articles are biased in several big ways: Selection bias, Confirmation bias, Political bias, Commerical bias and Cultural bias. Consider the source of the publication (Fox vs CNN). Just because someone published it on the internet does not make it true!
