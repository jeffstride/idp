This section will allow you to "window shop" for a good visualization. The content will provide 
helpful tips on how to create a good visualizations. 
These are popular plots with nice customizations that proved to be effective in prior Final Projects.

## Plots

Explanations and code for these types of plots:

- TimeSeries
- BarChart
- Geospatial
- Line/Scatter

## TODO
* [Correlation Heatmap](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39409866/correlation-heatmap)  
* Explain when to use:
    * ser.plot()  
    * df.plot()  
    * sns.lineplot()  
    * plt.plot()  
    * ax.plot()  
* Explain: figure, axis, grid, markers, ticks, labels, title (suptitle, too), spines. Naming convensions. ( axis.set_{name} where plot.{name})  
* Explain when do figures get reset in Replit (when do we need to do plt.cla() to clear current active axis, plt.clf() to clear entire current figure).  
* Explain how plt.gca() gets the current axis. So there is a concept of the current figure and current axis. plt.gcf() gets the current figure.
