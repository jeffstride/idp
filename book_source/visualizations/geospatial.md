# Geospatial Plots

Geospatial plots are great at:  
1. Showing how an **area** is impacted relative to other **areas.**  
2. Revealing which area is impacted.  
3. Illustrateing a pattern in the location of something.

Geospatial plots are NOT good at:  
1. Showing correlations. (Use a line plot for this)  
2. Emphasizing the amount of difference between one area and another.  

## Contiguous States Only
Let's start off by showing the benefits of showing only the contiguous United States. 
Imagine that we are trying to show which states have the most electoral college votes
and perhaps we want to emphasize that California has the most by a long shot.

````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Image
One the left, we see what many students show--the full 50 states.  
One the right, is a much improved image showing only the 48 contiguous states.

```
```{tab-item} Code
```python
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(15,5))

# Left Side: Plot the entire United States
gdf.plot(ax=ax1, column='Electoral Votes')

# Right Side: Plot the contiguous US with a legend
gdf.plot(ax=ax2, column='Electoral Votes', legend=True)
ax2.axis('off') # remove the box and the x,y ticks

# Set the extent of the axes to cut off Alaska and Hawaii
ax2.set_xlim(-130, -65)
ax2.set_ylim(24, 50)
```

```{tab-item} Data
This data is a merge of two different data sources: electoral_college.csv and a ShapeFile of the United States.  You'll note that in the code we were able to read column values `"707,558"` (a string with a literal comma as the thousands separator), by using the named parameter `thousands` in the `read_csv` call. Handy!! We also eliminated a duplicate column using `drop`.     
![election data](../_static/geo_elect_data.jpg)
```python
electoral = pd.read_csv('electoral_college.csv', thousands=',')
gdf = us_states.merge(electoral, left_on='NAME', right_on='State', how='left')
gdf = gdf.drop(columns='State') # this is a duplicate of 'NAME'
```

```{tab-item} Comments
In this example, we have two geospatial in one figure where there are just three differences.  
1. The box and ticks are hidden  
2. We clip off Alaska & Hawaii  
3. We show a legend  

By hiding Alaska and Hawaii, we can bring a much greater focus on the states. Providing a legend is very helpful. And, eliminating the box with longitude and latitude ticks removes an unnecessary distraction since we really don't care about the lat/long.  

In the chart on the right, we can easily see that California is large and brilliant yellow which ephasizes its impact. 
There are two ways to hide these states. One way is to eliminate them from the GeoDataFrame:  
`gdf = gdf[(gdf['NAME'] != 'Alaska') & (gdf['NAME'] != 'Hawaii')]`  
Another way is to set some limits on the x & y axes: `ax2.set_xlim(-130, -65)`
```
````

## Inset Alaska & Hawaii
Eliminating two states from the drawing isn't so great. We'd like to show Alaska and Hawaii like other maps do using an `inset`. This can be done, but it does get complicated rather quickly. The inset is a separate plot with separate arguments. When legends are shown, the size of the figure changes and the placement of the inset changes. I provide this code because it is educational to see and play with, but I recommend the method below this.

def draw_us_inset(gdf, **args):

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(12,5))

    # Plot the entire United States
    gdf.plot(ax=ax, **args)

    # Set the extent of the main plot to cut off Alaska & Hawaii
    ax.set_xlim(-130, -65)
    ax.set_ylim(23, 50)

    # helper method to plot both insets without a border, no legend, correct vmin/vmax
    def inset(position, name, xlim=None):
        '''
        position = a list: [x, y, width, height] in % of figure size
        '''
        ax = fig.add_axes(position)
        state = gdf[gdf['NAME'] == name]
        args_no_legend = args
        args_no_legend['legend'] = False
        # The new plot for the inset needs to have the vmin/vmax set to the same
        # values as the main plot so the colors show correctly
        if 'column' in args:
            args_no_legend['vmin'] = gdf[args['column']].min()
            args_no_legend['vmax'] = gdf[args['column']].max()
            
        state.plot(ax=ax, **args_no_legend)
        
        # remove box around inset in 1-line comprehension
        [ ax.spines[side].set_visible(False) for side in ['top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right'] ]
        
        # clip our inset if needed
        if xlim:
            ax.set_xlim(xlim)
        ax.set_xticks([])
        ax.set_yticks([])

    inset([0.20, 0.20, 0.20, 0.20], 'Alaska', xlim=(-180, -130))
    inset([0.37, 0.19, 0.05, 0.15], 'Hawaii')

draw_us_inset(gdf, column='Electoral Votes')
```


## Modified Geometry
It becomes much easier to deal with plotting the full United States if the GeoDataFrame's geometry is modified to put Alaska and Hawaii in the "right" spot. The only drawbacks are:  
* If you do geospatial `sjoin`s, then it'll all get messed up geographically.  
* If you want to illustrate something on the Pacific Ocean, there are states in the way!

```{tab-item} Comments
When the geometry of the GeoDataFrame is modified, the plotting code is pretty simple and allows for further customizations without crazy code. A few points worthy of calling out:  
* We use a `walrus` operator (`:=`) to assign a sub-expression to a variable in the middle of a larger expression. This allows us to reuse the value again later on in the code. It would have been just as easy to write it with two lines of code instead of one, but... _Bragging Rights!_  
* When modifying the GeoDataFrame, we used the <a href='https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.at.html' target='_blank'>`at` method</a> instead of `loc`. Using loc results in an error: "ValueError: Must have equal len keys and value when setting with an iterable".

## Annotated with Table Inset
The problem with the plot above is that it is very hard to see if there is any difference between Orgegon and Nevada; the colors are just too close! To fix that we will annotate each state with the count of the votes printed onto the state's location.

```{tab-item} Comments
We moved the legend to be horizontal, not because it was necessary, but because we can. This was accomplished by using the `legend_kwds` argument in the plot method. There are other ways to do this (as always).  

There are several issues that we address in this plotting solution: 
|Problem|Fix|  
|-------|---|  
|The black text doesn't show up well with the default colormap.|Change the `colormap` to 'cool'.|   
|The smaller states don't have room for the text. It all gets printed on top of each other and is unreadable.|Avoid annotating values on the states with a small geometry. We just manually do this, however, we could have used the 'CENSUSAREA' column to help us out with that. Doing it explicitly is good enough for us.|  
|The smaller states' values get lost when not shown!|Create an inset table that displays the values|  
|The dataframe of values is floating point|Use the apply method and a lambda to convert all the values to integer. There is probably another way... there always is!|

## Finding Obvious Correlations
Is there a correlation between population and electoral votes? Does the size of a state in square miles correlate to the number of electoral votes? Geospatial provides only minimal insight; a scatter plot is better. (todo: show how setting vmin, vmax can help illustrate a delta when correlations exist. For example, male/female pay across the states where female pay is lower, but still correlates.)


````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Image
One the top-left, you'll see a plot representing Electoral Votes by state. Were we to plot a geospatial plot of Population, we'd see something virtually identical and therefore a correrlation would be seen.  
One the top-right, you'll see a plot representing each state's size in square miles.

Were we to plot a geospatial plot of Population, we'd see something virtually identical to the top-left and, therefore, a correrlation would be seen. But, it would take **two** geospatial plots to show the correlation. And, in this specific case, the correlation is **extremely strong**; Electoral Votes is, in fact, calculated by a state's population. In this example, we omitted the second geospatial plot in favor of a scatter plot.   

One the top-right, you'll see a plot representing each state's size in square miles. Is there a correlation of a state's size to the count of Electoral Votes? It's a bit hard to determine from the geospatial plot. However, in combination with the scatter plots, one can be more confident in their assessment.  

**In summary**: we show 4 different plots in a single figure that in combination provide insight. The geospatial plots provide some understanding about where the Electoral Votes go geographically. Showing it side-by-side to the geospatial plot on Square Miles gives you an idea that there is _not an obvious_ correlation between votes and square miles. However, when we add the scatter plots, the correlations become a lot clearer. It is obvious that there is strong and direct relationship between population and votes, while there is very little, if any, correlation of square miles to votes. 

```{admonition} Using Statistics
:class: dropdown
In other sections, you can see how using Python libraries you can identify statistical information (e.g. Coefficient of Determination, Mean Square Error) to provide objective measurements of the correlation. In our example here, the Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$) for Votes vs Area is only 0.019 (which is extremely small) while for Votes vs Population the value is 0.991 (which is extremely high).  
```
````

## Correlations and Coefficient of Determination
In this example, we create three values (A, B, C) for each state. There is a strong correlation in the data, but the geospatial plots makes it hard to see. See if you can spot the correlations in the geospatial plots? Notice how the plots for **'Value A'** and **'Value C'** appear to be nearly identical, yet the relationship is somewhat hidden because of the scale on the colormap. Then, the scatter & line plots make it all very apparent. Read more in the **Plot Comments** and **Code Comments** tabs.

```
```{tab-item} Plot Comments
There is a lot going on here. First, let's discuss the geospatial plots. There appears to be some correlation
in all the geospatial plots, but it is hard to figure out. One might think that **Value A** and **Value C** are identical.
However, when we plot A, B, C all on the same color scale, you can see that **Value A (on B scale)** is quite different
from **Value C (on B scale)**. Can you see the relationship between **Value A** and **Value B**? I think you
can see that there is _some_ relationship, but it is hard to understand what it is and how strong it is.  

Now, let's look at the scatter and line plots. The dots alone shows a clear linear relationship. When we
add the line, the correlation is bolstered.  

But, how strong is the correlation? To determine this, we displayed the **Coefficient of Determination** value
on the plot directly. The larger the value (closer to 1.0), the strong the correlation. The $R^2$ value basically
tells us what percentage of the value on the y-axis is due to the value on the x-axis. We see that the values of
$R^2$ are 0.736 and 0.948 respectively. These are quite high.   

Lastly, the best plot is the last one which combines all the information into a single plot. If you're trying
to show correlation with **Value A**, the last plot is all you need.
```

```{tab-item} Code Comments
In this plot, we generated the line using the method `stats` that we imported with: `from scipy import stats`. 
We calculated the slope and y-intercept from the data points and used that to plot the line. It was critically
important to first sort the values by the x-axis (in our case, by **Value A**).

We could have generated the line in the plot using `seaborn.regplot`. While this would have drawn our line
for us automatically, it does not provide the **Coefficient of Determination**. So, instead, we get all 
the **Line of Best Fit** information using `stats.linregress`.   

To present the $R^2$ value on the plot, we need to choose where to "print" it using the `ax.text` method.
To accomplish this, we plotted the graph with the text first, identified an open space, and then added
the printing code. The $R^2$ value is a lot of digits after the decimal place that just get in the way. We choose to print the value
using Python's string <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" 
target="_blank">formatting</a> functionality as built into Pythons <a href="https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/" 
target="_blank">f-string</a>. The API is a bit complicated to understand. It is similar
to the way Java implements `printf`, only it has different escape sequences and specifics. In short, when a
string literal is preceded with 'f' then the string is expecting to have some
formatting sequence in it. A formatting sequence is embedded inside curly braces `{}` and the text
inside the curly braces is interpreted. It would contain identifiers, method calls, and possibly
formatting options following a colon. Here is the syantax for printing a floating point number with some text label:  

    f'text{<identifer>:.<integer>f}'
    
For example, let's say we do the following:  

    gpa = 3.899
    print(f'GPA={gpa:.2f}')

That code results in printing, `GPA=3.90` (due to rounding to 2 decimal places).

To set the color scales to match in each of the geospatial plots, we set both `vmin` and `vmax`. When we
don't set these, the plot will customize the colors to match the data being plotted. This is often what you
want to do, but if you're attempting to see a relationship between two geospatial plots, setting vmin and
vmax are important.    

The vertical spacing between the all the plots was originally not good enough. The line plots had their
x-axis' labels occluded by the titles of the graphs below them. So, we added vertical spacing with
`plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.3)`. This actually makes the spacing be too large in the geospatial plots.
We could have customized the spacing across all the subplots by using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/userdemo/demo_gridspec03.html" target="_blank">matplotlib GridSpec</a>. But, since that code is pretty foreign and not
at all the focus of this discussion, we left the spacing as-is.
