# Feature Importance 

**Feature importance** is a concept in machine learning (ML) that helps us understand and quantify the impact of 
different **features** on the predictions made by a model. It allows us to identify which features are more 
influential in contributing to the model's performance and predictions.  

Too often students will create a model, provide some accuracy scores and then move on to other topics. This is a travesty
because understanding the model (how it makes its predictions) is important. To illustrate this point, this page will review 
a few models, show their predictions, and then explore how the features impact the predictions. (Feature Importance)   

Once a feature's importance is known, a Data Scientist can choose to take several actions:  
* make conclusions about features (obvious)  
* eliminate a feature from the set of features (because it is so small)   
* do a deeper dive study on select features   
    * Example: a _fairness_ analysis (see classification study)  

There are several techniques to measure _feature importance_. This unit will go over a few of these techniques.

## Coefficient Magnitudes (Linear Models)
In linear regression and other linear models, the magnitude of the coefficients assigned to each feature gives an indication of its importance. Larger absolute coefficients imply stronger impact on the output variable.

```{tab-item} Code
```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_f, test_f, train_l, test_l = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2)

# Initialize the Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the training data which calculates model's coefficients
model.fit(train_f, train_l)

# Associate the coefficients and feature names
# Print the coefficients and feature names using f-string formatting
for f, c in zip(features.columns, model.coef_):
    print(f'{f}   : {c:.3f}')

```
```{tab-item} Comments
The following is how to interpret coefficient magnitudes for feature importance:

**Coefficient Magnitude:** The magnitude of the coefficient reflects the strength and direction of its influence on the target variable. A larger coefficient magnitude (positive or negative) indicates that the feature has a greater influence.

1. A positive coefficient suggests that an increase in the value of the feature will result in an increase in the model's output. This signifies that the feature has a positive linear connection with the target variable.

2. A negative coefficient indicates that an increase in the value of the feature will result in a decrease in the model's output. This shows a negative linear relationship between the feature and the label.

**Magnitude Comparison:** By comparing the magnitudes of coefficients across different features, you can rank features based on their relative importance. Features with larger absolute coefficients are generally considered more important in influencing the model's predictions.

## Permutation Importance
This is a technique used to measure the importance of features in a model by evaluating how much the model's performance drops when the values of a specific feature are randomly shuffled. The idea is that important features contribute significantly to the model's prediction, so shuffling their values would lead to drop in performance.
````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Goal
1. Train a model and record its performance on the original set
2. Randomly shuffle the values of a single feature in the set
3. Calculate the performance again using the shuffled data
4. Compare the drop in performance to the original performance. **A larger drop indicates that the shuffled feature is important.**
```
```{tab-item} Code
```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_f, test_f, train_l, test_l = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2)

# Create and Train a Random Forest classifier with 100 decision trees
# n_estimators esnuers for the same results every time the program is run, as long as other factors remain constant
# random_state allows for the model to re
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(train_f, train_l)

# Evaluate the model's performance on the original dataset
original_accuracy = accuracy_score(test_l, model.predict(test_f))
print(f"Original Accuracy: {original_accuracy:.4f}")

# Calculate permutation importance
perm_importance = permutation_importance(model, test_f, test_l, n_repeats=30)

# Print feature importance scores
print("Permutation Importance Scores:")
// importances_mean is the average importance scores for each feature
for idx, score in enumerate(perm_importance.importances_mean):
    print(f"Feature {i}: {score:.4f}")
```

Remember that the larger the drop in performance after shuffling a feature, the more important that feature is. Permutation importance provides insights into the relative importance of features based on their impact on model performance.
